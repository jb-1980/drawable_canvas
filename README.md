Drawable Canvas
==============
I found the scratch pad in Khan Academy's exercises really useful. This app seeks to emulate that functionality. It is just a full page canvas, but includes the ability to select colors, and undo.

TODO:
[] Find a way to erase a part of the drawing by mousing over it. Khan Academy's does have this, but I have not yet been able to reproduce it.
